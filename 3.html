    <h2>Popular Coding Language to Learn</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="language.jpg" width="100%" />Since the 1970s, computer experts
      have created more than 700 different programming languages. Each language
      has a unique way of helping computers process huge amounts of information.
      Every coding language has different features and terms with some overlap.
      New coders shouldn’t be overwhelmed by the plethora of programming types
      though. There are only about a dozen programming languages that are
      commonly used. These include Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, Cobol, Objective-C,
      Visual Basic, and Perl. Let’s look at some of the major coding languages
      about which beginners should know.
