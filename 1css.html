    <h2>How Coding works</h2>
    <p>
      To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what to do. To
      go a bit deeper, computers don’t understand words. They only understand
      the concepts of on and off. The capabilities of a computer are guided by
      on and off switches, or transistors. Binary code represents these on and
      off transistors as the digits 1 and 0. An infinite number of combinations
      of these codes make your computer work. In order to make binary code
      manageable, computer programming languages were formed. These languages
      each serve different purposes, but they all allow programmers to translate
      important commands into binary code. Each computer application needs a
      properly written code to know what to do. Most software has thousands to
      billions of lines of coded text and numbers. The code gives computers a
      step-by-step guide on how to function. Computers speed through reading the
      code to execute every online and offline task. In today’s digital world,
      everything from mobile phones to smart TVs and cars run using coded
      software. For example, the code might tell the computer to input an image
      and make it spin. Creating flawless code is essential to avoid 404 error
      pop-ups and software crashes. Debugging code is always the final step to
      reveal and fix coding issues.
