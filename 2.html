    <h2>Is Learning to Code Difficult?</h2>
    <p>
      Coding isn’t that hard for tech-savvy people who patiently put in the time
      and effort to learn. Coding gets an unnecessarily bad reputation from
      people who weren’t persistent enough to practice. The easiest coding
      languages only involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. That’s a
      tiny sliver in comparison to learning a spoken foreign language. Once the
      easier languages are mastered, it’s relatively simple to learn other ways
      to code. Many programming languages use similar methods to code and debug
      computer applications. Beginners starting to code must possess certain
      skills to be successful. Having strong attention to detail to pour over
      long lines of coded text is imperative. New coders need abstract thinking
      skills to visualize what written code will become. Novices must have
      problem-solving skills to persist against challenges without letting
      frustration win. Intuitive logical reasoning skills help coders correctly
      conclude why a code isn’t working right. Good writing skills are critical
      to creating code that appropriately conveys the intended message.
      Technology skills are also an obvious requirement for coders to fearlessly
      work with computer programs.
